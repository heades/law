This is my private library for conducting my work in categorical
logic.  Feel free to use it, or contribute in anyway.

  Category.agda - Contains the basic definition of a category.
  Categories will be defined using total setoids instead of being
  defined using the function space between objects as the type of the
  hom.

  Setoid/Total.agda - The definition of total setoids.  See "Setoids
  in Type Theory" by Barthe et al.
